# Triage Issues

Triage the following tickets: $ARGUMENTS

## Context: Open issues

!`gh issue list --repo storyblok/storyblok-swift --state open --limit 30 --json number,title,labels 2>/dev/null || echo "Could not fetch open issues"`

## Instructions

Read the ticket thoroughly, but do not dig into code. The goal is to classify, prioritize, and
decide the next action.

### Step 1: Parse ticket references

- Anything matching `DX-\d+` or a `linear.app` URL → **Linear**
- Anything matching `#\d+`, a bare number, or a `github.com` URL → **GitHub**
- `linear:triage` → fetch all Linear issues in Triage state (DX team)

### Step 2: Fetch tickets

**GitHub issues:**

```bash
gh issue view <number> --repo storyblok/storyblok-swift --json title,body,labels,state,comments,author,createdAt
```

**Linear:**

```bash
bash .agents/skills/triage/scripts/linear-fetch.sh issue DX-123 DX-456
bash .agents/skills/triage/scripts/linear-fetch.sh triage
```

### Step 3: Assess each ticket

#### 3a. Type classification

| Type              | Description                                                             |
| ----------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **bug**           | Something is broken — wrong behavior, crash, regression                 |
| **feature**       | New capability that doesn't exist today                                 |
| **improvement**   | Enhancement to existing functionality (DX, performance, API ergonomics) |
| **documentation** | Missing, incorrect, or outdated docs                                    |
| **question**      | User asking for help, not reporting a problem                           |

Verify the reporter's classification if present — reporters often mislabel improvements as bugs or
features as improvements. State whether confirmed or corrected.

#### 3b. Reproducibility

Rate as: `reproducible` · `likely-reproducible` · `needs-reproduction` · `not-applicable`

For **needs-reproduction**, list exactly what's missing (SDK version, Xcode/Swift version, OS version,
target platform, minimal repro, stack trace, etc.).

#### 3c. Priority assessment

Score each ticket on these dimensions, then derive an overall priority.

**Impact:**

- `blocker`: Prevents core functionality, no workaround
- `critical`: Major functionality broken, workaround exists
- `degraded`: Works but with noticeable problems
- `minor`: Cosmetic, edge case, or negligible effect

**Breadth:**

- `widespread`: Affects most/all users of the target
- `common`: Common scenario
- `uncommon`: Specific configuration or setup
- `edge-case`: Rare conditions or unusual usage

**Urgency:**

- `regression`: Worked before, broke recently
- `new-defect`: Never worked, newly discovered
- `longstanding`: Has been this way for a while

**Overall priority:**

| Priority          | Criteria                                                      |
| ----------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **P0 — Critical** | Blocker + widespread/common                                   |
| **P1 — High**     | Critical + common, or blocker + uncommon                      |
| **P2 — Medium**   | Degraded + common, or critical + edge-case                    |
| **P3 — Low**      | Minor impact, edge-case, or longstanding with easy workaround |

#### 3d. Verdict

| Verdict        | When to use                                               |
| -------------- | --------------------------------------------------------- |
| **actionable** | Enough info to proceed                                    |
| **needs-info** | Cannot proceed without more information from the reporter |
| **duplicate**  | Already tracked elsewhere — link to the original          |
| **not-a-bug**  | Working as intended, user error, or environment issue     |
| **wont-fix**   | Valid but out of scope or conflicts with design direction |

#### 3e. Duplicate search

Search for duplicates on every ticket:

- GitHub:
  `gh issue list --repo storyblok/storyblok-swift --search "<keywords>" --state open --limit 10 --json number,title,labels`
- Linear: check `relations` field from the fetch response

If exact duplicate → mark as **duplicate** with link to original. If related but different → note
the connection.

### Step 4: Present results

#### Summary table

```markdown
## Triage Summary

| Ticket | Title | Type        | Priority | Verdict    | Target             |
| ------ | ----- | ----------- | -------- | ---------- | ------------------ |
| #12    | ...   | bug         | P1       | actionable | StoryblokClient    |
| DX-123 | ...   | improvement | P2       | actionable | RichTextView       |
```

#### Detailed assessment (one per ticket)

```markdown
### <ticket-id>: <title>

**Source:** GitHub / Linear **Type:** <type> (correct reporter's classification if needed)
**Reproducibility:** <assessment> **Priority:** <P0-P3> — <label>

- Impact: <level> (<reason>)
- Breadth: <level> (<reason>)
- Urgency: <level> (<reason>)
- Related: <linked tickets if any> **Target / platform:** <target, platform> **Verdict:** <verdict>

**Summary:** <2-3 sentences>

**Suggested next step:** <what to do next>
```

For **needs-info** tickets, include a draft reply asking for the missing information.

## Output

Write results to `claude-output/triage-<identifier>.md` (e.g. `triage-424.md`,
`triage-box-03-20.md`) and present the summary table directly to the user.

## Rules

- **Read-only.** Never create, update, comment on, or close issues on GitHub or Linear.
- **Always write a report.** Every triage run must produce a `claude-output/triage-<identifier>.md`
  file.
- **No code analysis.** Use `/investigate` for deep dives.
- When unsure, lean toward **bug** and higher priority — better to investigate than dismiss.
- For Linear triage box: process all tickets, sort output by priority (P0 first).
